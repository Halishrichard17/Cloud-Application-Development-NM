# Prerequisites <br>
•	An IBM Cloud Account.<br>
•	An account on IBM Cloud Pak for Data.<br>
•	Python2.7 (Flask,Pickel).<br>

# PHASE 1 <br>
<p>
	The objective of this project is to leverage IBM Cloud Watson Studio to train a
machine learning model and deploy it as a web service. The project's primary goal is
to gain proficiency in predictive analytics by developing a model capable of making
real-time predictions. This encompasses defining a predictive use case, selecting an
appropriate dataset, training the machine learning model, deploying it as a web
service, and integrating it into applications. 
</p>

# PHASE 2  <br>
Technical Architecture:

Technical architecture which is also often referred to as application architecture includes the major components of the system, their relationships, and the contracts that define the interactions between the components. The goal of technical architects is to achieve all the business needs with an application that is optimized for both performance and security.

# PHASE 3

1.	Create a new Cloud Pak for Data project and Cloud Object Storage service.
2.	Import require Data Set as Train and test for web phishing.
3.	Build a model with AutoAI.
4.	Deploy the model with WML.
5.	Create Job without schedule.
6.	Run the Job.

# PHASE 4
1.	Create deployment as online type .
2.	Copy  private end point link and API.
3.	Develop flask program for get the Data model.
4.	Develop web site for UI for input and output.

# PHASE 5


We just give example for https://web.whatsapp.vb as whatapp link.

A whatapp link is Suspicious.

The median efficiency is used to assess each categorization model's effectiveness. The final item will appear in the way it was envisioned. Graphical representations are used to depict information during classification. The percentage of predictions made using the testing dataset is used to gauge accuracy. By dividing the entire number of forecasts even by properly predicted estimates, it is simple to calculate. The difference between actual and anticipated output is used to calculate accuracy


## Conclusion
Phishing detection is now an area of great interest among the researchers due to its significance in protecting privacy and providing security. There are many methods to perform phishing detection. Our system aims to enhance the detection method to detect phishing websites using machine learning technology. We achieved a high detection accuracy, and the results show that the classifiers give better performance when we use more data as training data. In future, hybrid technology will be implemented to detect phishing websites more accurately.
