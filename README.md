# PHASE 1 <br>"
<p>
	The objective of this project is to leverage IBM Cloud Watson Studio to train a
machine learning model and deploy it as a web service. The project's primary goal is
to gain proficiency in predictive analytics by developing a model capable of making
real-time predictions. This encompasses defining a predictive use case, selecting an
appropriate dataset, training the machine learning model, deploying it as a web
service, and integrating it into applications. 
</p>

# PHASE 2  <br>
Technical Architecture:

Technical architecture which is also often referred to as application architecture includes the major components of the system, their relationships, and the contracts that define the interactions between the components. The goal of technical architects is to achieve all the business needs with an application that is optimized for both performance and security.
